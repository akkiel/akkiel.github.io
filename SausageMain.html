				Boy, I tell ya what a way to end the year!! The begging of this semester I dropped 2 classes in anticipation of getting straight
				A's. Well, out of the 7 classes I started with this semester I will be passing 4. I guess that above 50% so not as bad as it sounds.
				But my digital logic class, I was a dumby and checked the spring semester final schedule instead of the fall semester schedule.
				And yes, I feel as dumb as it sounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh and as far as the classes I passed, one was online, one was a once a week lecture and one im pretty sure im passing
				with a D. How's this for a first post since 2008.

				Here I'm gonna try to make a website that has nothing to do with anything and maybe something to do with nothing.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is a work in progress and I literally can't make this website any worse than it already is. Will be updated daily hopefully.
				Until i return to school and the internet wont let me port forward.
